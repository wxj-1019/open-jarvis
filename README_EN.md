## What is Jarvis

OpenJarvis is a personal AI agent that is easier to use than traditional coding agents. It has memory, personality, and can act autonomously. Multiple agents can work together on your machine.

As an assistant, it is gentle: no complex configuration files, no obscure jargon. Jarvis is designed not just for coders, but for everyone who works at a computer.
As a tool, it is powerful: it remembers everything you've said, operates your computer, browses the web, searches for information, reads and writes files, executes code, manages schedules, and can even learn new skills on its own.

## Features

**Memory** — A custom memory system that keeps recent events sharp and lets older ones fade naturally.

**Personality** — Not a generic "AI assistant". Each agent has its own voice and behavior through personality templates. Agents are self-contained folders, easy to back up and manage.

**Tools** — Read/write files, run one-shot commands or persistent terminal sessions, browse the web, search the internet through browser-backed or API providers, take screenshots and segmented long screenshots, preview media, and inspect pages. Covers the vast majority of daily work scenarios.

**Skills** — Built-in compatibility with the community Skills ecosystem. Agents can also install skills from GitHub or write their own. Strict safety review enabled by default.

**Character Cards & Skill Bundles** — Export and import agents as local-first character-card zip packages with allowlisted identity, avatar, optional memory, and skills. Skill Bundles are separate skill-pack infrastructure: group skills, drag them between bundles, toggle a whole bundle for an agent, and export a bundle as a standalone zip for migration or sharing.

**Multi-Agent** — Create multiple agents, each with independent memory, personality, and scheduled tasks. Agents can collaborate via channel group chats or delegate tasks to each other.

**Desk** — Each agent has a desk for files and notes (Jian). Supports drag-and-drop, file preview, and workspace file-tree change watching, serving as an async collaboration space between you and your agent.

**Full-Screen Media Viewer** — Click any image, SVG, or video from chat or the desk to open a dark-overlay viewer with wheel-zoom, drag-to-pan, `+` / `−` / `0` shortcuts, and left/right navigation between sibling media in the same session or folder.

**Cron & Heartbeat** — Agents can run scheduled tasks and periodically check for file changes on the desk. They work autonomously even when you're away.

**Sandbox** — Two-layer isolation: application-level PathGuard with four access tiers + OS-level sandboxing (macOS Seatbelt / Linux Bubblewrap / Windows AppContainer). Agents can read ordinary system files, while writes and deletes stay limited to the workspace and managed data folders. External network access can use system proxy, manual proxy, or direct mode.

**Plugins** — Extensible plugin system with a convention-first architecture. Install community plugins by drag-and-drop. Plugins can contribute tools, skills, commands, agent templates, HTTP routes, event hooks, LLM providers, pages, widgets, configuration schemas, and background tasks. Routes have direct access to core services (PluginContext injection) and can interact with agent sessions via the Session Bus. Two-level permission model (restricted / full-access) keeps things safe.

**Multi-Platform Bridge** — A single agent can connect to Telegram, Feishu, QQ, and WeChat bots simultaneously. Chat from any platform and remotely operate your computer. Bridge sessions carry platform context, and notifications can be delivered back to the current external platform.

**i18n** — Interface available in 5 languages: Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, and Traditional Chinese.

## Quick Start

### Download

**macOS (Apple Silicon / Intel):** download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/liliMozi/openjarvis/releases).

The app is signed and notarized with an Apple Developer ID. macOS should allow it to launch directly.

**Windows:** download the latest `.exe` installer from [Releases](https://github.com/liliMozi/openjarvis/releases).

> **Windows SmartScreen notice:** The installer is not yet code-signed. Windows Defender SmartScreen may show a warning on first run. Click **More info** → **Run anyway**. This is expected for unsigned builds.

**Linux:** download the latest `.AppImage` or `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/liliMozi/openjarvis/releases).

### First Run

On first launch, an onboarding wizard will guide you through setup: choose a language, enter your name, connect a model provider (API key + base URL), and select three models — a **chat model** (main conversation), a **utility model** (lightweight tasks), and a **utility large model** (memory compilation and deep analysis). In settings you can also choose a **vision model** that lets text-only chat models work with image attachments through Vision Bridge. Jarvis supports OpenAI-compatible providers, Anthropic-style providers, OAuth providers, and local models via Ollama.

## Architecture

```
core/           Engine orchestration + Managers (including PluginManager)
lib/            Core libraries (memory, tools, sandbox, bridge adapters)
server/         Hono HTTP + WebSocket server (standalone Node.js process)
hub/            Scheduler, ChannelRouter, EventBus
desktop/        Electron app + React frontend
shared/         Cross-layer utilities (config schema, error bus, model refs)
plugins/        Built-in system plugins (bundled into app)
skills2set/     Built-in skill definitions
scripts/        Build tools (server bundler, launcher, signing)
tests/          Vitest test suite
```

The engine layer coordinates multiple managers (Agent, Session, Model, Preferences, Skill, Channel, BridgeSession, Plugin, etc.) and exposes them through a unified facade. The Hub handles background tasks (heartbeat, cron, channel routing, agent messaging, DM routing) independently of the active chat session.

User-visible files inside a session are registered through `SessionFile` sidecars. Desktop, Bridge, and future mobile surfaces consume the same file identity according to their own capabilities. Bridge media delivery rules live in `.docs/BRIDGE-MEDIA-CAPABILITIES.md`; plugin file contribution rules live in `PLUGINS.md`.

Local staged files are uploaded directly by platform adapters when possible: Telegram / Feishu / WeChat use their native upload flows, and QQ uses the official bot chunked-upload flow before sending `msg_type: 7` rich media. `preferences.bridge.mediaPublicBaseUrl` / `HANA_BRIDGE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` are only for consumers or fallback paths that still require an internet-reachable URL.

The server runs as a standalone Node.js process (spawned by Electron or independently), bundled via Vite with @vercel/nft for dependency tracing. It communicates with the Electron renderer through WebSocket.
User data is rooted at `HANA_HOME` (`~/.hanako` in production, `~/.hanako-dev` in development). The Pi SDK's own data is isolated under `${HANA_HOME}/.pi/`.
