# Hana Plugin SDK

Hana's plugin SDK is split into small packages so plugin authors can choose only the layer they need.

| Package | Runs In | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `@hana/plugin-protocol` | iframe / host | Shared protocol constants and message shapes for plugin UI. |
| `@hana/plugin-sdk` | iframe browser code | Typed helpers for `ready`, resize, toast, external links, clipboard, and lower-level host requests. |
| `@hana/plugin-runtime` | plugin Node runtime | Helpers for tools, lifecycle plugins, EventBus handlers, SessionFile media details, providers, and Pi SDK extensions. |
| `@hana/plugin-components` | iframe React UI | Hana-styled React primitives with theme fallback: controls, cards, rows, lists, and empty states. |

For the end-to-end plugin author workflow, read `.docs/PLUGIN-DEVELOPMENT.md` first, then use this file as the SDK package map.

Run `npm run build:packages` after SDK changes. The command builds all SDK packages and their `.d.ts` files:

```bash
npm run build:packages
```

## Runtime Boundary

The SDK packages are developer-facing source/build dependencies. The app package still excludes `packages/**`, so plugin UI code should bundle `@hana/plugin-sdk` and `@hana/plugin-components` into its iframe assets. Runtime helpers from `@hana/plugin-runtime` should be bundled or installed with the plugin when the plugin is distributed outside the monorepo.

Built-in plugins may use the same source patterns, but they should be checked against the packaged server bundle before release. The host does not silently provide these SDK packages as global runtime modules.

## Plugin Shape Guide

- Tool-only plugins usually need only `tools/*.js` and `@hana/plugin-runtime` helpers. They can stay `restricted`.
- Runtime plugins use `index.js` for lifecycle, EventBus handlers, background tasks, schedules, or dynamic tools. They require `trust: "full-access"`.
- UI plugins use iframe routes plus `@hana/plugin-sdk` and, for React UI, `@hana/plugin-components`. They require `trust: "full-access"` and explicit `ui.hostCapabilities` grants for host calls such as `external.open` or `clipboard.writeText`.
- Provider contribution plugins use `providers/*.js` declarations. They require `trust: "full-access"` and should declare `capabilities.chat` separately from `capabilities.media.*` so chat selectors stay clean while image, video, or speech tools discover media providers.
- Marketplace metadata lives outside the app repo in `OH-Plugins`, the official community plugin catalog. The app reads the generated catalog URL by default, installs `distribution.kind = "release"` entries by downloading the zip package and verifying `sha256`, and keeps `distribution.kind = "source"` for local file marketplace development only. `versions[]` lets the catalog keep multiple SemVer releases; Hana selects the highest app-compatible version, blocks implicit downgrades, backs up old installs, and records successful installs in `${HANA_HOME}/plugin-installs.json`. `readmePath` is resolved relative to the catalog when the official URL is used.

## Agent Dev Loop

Agent-assisted plugin work should use Hana's dev loop instead of copying work-in-progress code into the production plugin directory.

- Source stays in the workspace or `${HANA_HOME}/plugin-dev-sources/`.
- `plugin.dev.install` copies the source into `${HANA_HOME}/plugins-dev/<pluginId>` and loads it through the normal `PluginManager`.
- `plugin.dev.reload` replaces the dev copy from the same source slot.
- `plugin.dev.disable`, `plugin.dev.enable`, `plugin.dev.reset`, and `plugin.dev.uninstall` control only the remembered dev slot. They do not write normal plugin preferences and do not remove community installs.
- `plugin.dev.invokeTool` runs a tool smoke test with explicit input.
- `plugin.dev.diagnostics` returns dev slots, load status, logs, surfaces, and plugin diagnostics.
- `plugin.dev.listSurfaces` and `plugin.dev.describeSurfaceDebug` drive UI debugging.

Agent-callable dev tools are opt-in. The user must enable "Allow Agent plugin dev tools" in Settings -> Plugins before the Agent sees `plugin_dev_install`, `plugin_dev_reload`, `plugin_dev_disable`, `plugin_dev_enable`, `plugin_dev_reset`, `plugin_dev_uninstall`, `plugin_dev_invoke_tool`, `plugin_dev_diagnostics`, `plugin_dev_list_surfaces`, `plugin_dev_describe_surface`, or `plugin_dev_run_scenario`.

The trusted development identity comes from Hana's install record and the `${HANA_HOME}/plugins-dev/` slot, not from a manifest field. Pass `devRunId` when controlling lifecycle if the Agent has one, so stale tool calls cannot accidentally act on a newer dev run.

UI debugging is element-first. A capable Agent should inspect accessible elements, text, roles, labels, and stable locators before asking for screenshots. Screenshots are still useful for visual polish, clipping, theme contrast, and blank-state checks, but they are no longer the first source of truth when Hana can expose semantic UI structure.

## UI Path

Use `@hana/plugin-sdk` for host communication:

```ts
import { hana } from '@hana/plugin-sdk';

hana.ready();
hana.ui.resize({ height: 320 });
await hana.toast.show({ message: 'Ready' });
```

Use `@hana/plugin-components` for iframe UI:

```tsx
import { Button, CardShell, HanaThemeProvider } from '@hana/plugin-components';
import '@hana/plugin-components/styles.css';

export function Panel() {
  return (
    <HanaThemeProvider mode="inherit">
      <CardShell title="Plugin">
        <Button variant="primary">Run</Button>
      </CardShell>
    </HanaThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

Theme fallback order is:

1. Explicit custom tokens passed to `HanaThemeProvider`.
2. Named Hana tokens when `mode="hana"`.
3. Host CSS variables when `mode="inherit"`.
4. SDK defaults in `@hana/plugin-components/styles.css`.

## Runtime Path

Use `@hana/plugin-runtime` for Node-side plugin code:

```js
import { definePlugin, defineTool, registerTask, requestBus } from '@hana/plugin-runtime';
```

Tools should return local files through `stageFile()` and `createMediaDetails()` so desktop, Bridge, Mobile PWA, and future remote clients all consume the same `SessionFile` / Resource identity.

Lifecycle plugins should declare `activationEvents` in `manifest.json` when they do not need to start on app launch. Existing lifecycle plugins without this field still activate on startup for compatibility.

Long-running plugins should use the runtime task helpers (`registerTask`, `updateTask`, `completeTask`, `failTask`, `cancelTask`, `scheduleTask`) instead of hand-writing EventBus payloads.

For Agent-assisted development, plugins can declare `manifest.dev.scenarios`. These are not runtime features; they are smoke-test instructions for Hana's dev loop and should only describe repeatable checks such as invoking a tool, expecting text in the result, or opening a declared UI surface.

Provider plugins can use `defineProvider()` for TypeScript-friendly authoring, then export named provider fields from `providers/*.js`:

```js
import { defineProvider } from '@hana/plugin-runtime';

const provider = defineProvider({
  id: 'my-image-cli',
  displayName: 'My Image CLI',
  authType: 'none',
  runtime: {
    kind: 'local-cli',
    protocolId: 'local-cli-media',
    command: {
      executable: 'my-image-cli',
      args: [
        { literal: 'generate' },
        { option: '--prompt', from: 'prompt' },
        { option: '--model', from: 'modelId' },
        { option: '--output', from: 'outputDir' },
      ],
      timeoutMs: 120000,
      output: { kind: 'file_glob', directory: 'outputDir', pattern: '*.png' },
    },
  },
  capabilities: {
    chat: { projection: 'none' },
    media: {
      imageGeneration: {
        models: [{
          id: 'my-image-model',
          displayName: 'My Image Model',
          protocolId: 'local-cli-media',
          inputs: ['text'],
          outputs: ['image'],
        }],
      },
    },
  },
});

export const { id, displayName, authType, runtime, capabilities } = provider;
```

CLI-backed providers must use structured argument bindings. Avoid shell command strings; the host runtime validates the contract and runs local commands through non-shell execution.

See `examples/plugins/sdk-showcase/` for a compact plugin that shows the current recommended shape.
